### Overview:
**josephcalise.com** is my personal portfolio site that houses my About Me, Project (in development), Work Experience, and Contact links. The site was designed and created by myself with the use of 
MapBox API. The site was originally made with HTML/CSS and Vanilla JavaScript, but after further improvements and projects it has been updated to include the use of the technologies: NodeJS, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express. The website is hosted on a DigitalOcean Droplet with the use of an Apache Webserver.

### Features:
As mentioned above, the first major feature included when this was a static site was the use of the MapBox API. This API was used to generate a map that had icons of all the USCG units I was stationed at
as well as other relevant work experience. Each icon was clickable with a pop-up description of each location.

**Wordle Clone:**
 During a semester break, I created a clone of the popular game Wordle, with a leaderboard implementation. That GitHub Repo can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/josephcalise/wordle-clone-leaderboard">here.</a> With the new addition, I implemented a backend for the site to perform the CRUD actions needed with Worlde. The backend technologies used included: NodeJS, MongoDB, Express, and Mongoose. The website is hosted on a DigitalOcean Droplet with the use of an Apache Webserver.
