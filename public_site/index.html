                    <p class="about-me-text-1">My name is Joseph Calise and I am an aspiring Software Engineer. For the
                        most part I am
                        self-taught developer driven by curiosity and amazement of what can be accomplished by someone
                        with an idea, a
                        computer and the skill to code. In my personal life, I enjoy being outdoors, watching T.V and
                        spending time with my
                        wife and friends. I served in the United States Coast Guard from 2016 to 2020 and ended my
                        enlistment as a
                        Boatswain’s Mate Second Class.</p>

                    <p class="about-me-text-2">Generally, Boatswain’s Mates will go on to be boat captains, cops or
                        merchant mariners. But
                        at the end of my enlistment, I knew none of those were for me. I knew I wanted to be in
                        technology, but I didn’t
                        know in what capacity. My start in technology was in IT with GreenCoast Hydroponics. While
                        working there I was able
                        to obtain my CompTIA Network+ and CompTIA Security+ within less than a year of each other. From
                        there I worked with
                        our development team and knew that was the path for me. Since my departure from GreenCoast I
                        have made strides to
                        accomplishing my goals and becoming a Software Engineer. In this time, I have taught myself
                        HTML, CSS and
                        JavaScript, as well as, being on track to graduate in 2023 with a BS in Computer Science from
                        Chapman University in
                        Orange, CA. I look forward to continuing to pursue my passion in this field and hope to grow
                        into a seasoned
                        Software Engineer.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-me-text-3">Since beginning my journey into coding and software engineering, it is
                        incomprehensible to
                        put into words what you can do with code. Since brushing the surface, there is nothing
                        professionally I would rather
                        be doing than this. It is no secret that software engineering continues to be the future, but it
                        is mind boggling to
                        know that with the right knowledge and creativity, you can quite literally change the world all
                        beginning with
                        <strong>code</strong>.

                                    provide for the safety of the boat and the crew. At station Chatham, I earned the

                                    up to a million dollars. <strong>I accumulated more than 200 underway hours as a

                                    complete 6 weeks of law enforcement training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training
                                    Center (FLETC) in Charleston, South Carolina. During this training you are exposed
                                    to the authority and jurisdictions of Coast Guard law enforcement, local and
                                    international maritime laws and statutes, as well as critical stress management and
                                    decision making in deadly force situations. <strong>As a Boarding Officer I lead law
                                        enforcement teams in over 50 recreational boating safety boardings and more than
                                        35 Maritime Security and Response Operations.</strong></p>

                                    thinking and extensive knowledge of each mission the unit preforms. During the duty
                                    period, which ranges from 48 to 72 hours, the OOD must maintain the unit’s readiness
                                    to respond to a multitude of missions during <strong>all</strong> hours of that duty
                                    period. The OOD must also have fluid and effective planning to balance training
                                    personnel and maintaining unit readiness for missions. This includes maintaining
                                    proper boat crews and law enforcement teams that are ready to undertake and complete
                                    any mission that may come up. <strong>As the Officer of the Day, I planned and
                                        executed upwards of 50 law enforcement events, 7 search and rescue cases, and
                                        the training and certification of 10 junior personnel in a collection of
